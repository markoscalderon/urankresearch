By using a biomedical engineering approach, a uniform grid sampling strategy could be used to improve the detection efficiency of prostate biopsy. Moreover, the calibration of the sampling can be adjusted by altering the distance between needle deployments.

In vitro studies investigate the basic phenomena related to gene delivery, stem cell behavior, tissue regeneration, and to explore dynamic culture potentiality in different applications: cardiac and skeletal muscle, cartilage, hematopoietic system, peripheral nerve, and gene delivery. Specific fields of regenerative medicine, i.e., bone, blood vessels, and ligaments engineering have already reached the preclinical stage providing promising insights for further research towards clinical applications.

Although recovery of nerve function occurs in many mild injuries, outcomes are often unsatisfactory following severe trauma. Nerve repair and regeneration presents unique clinical challenges and opportunities, and substantial contributions can be made through the informed application of biomedical engineering strategies. This article reviews the clinical presentations and classification of nerve injuries, in addition to the state of the art for surgical decision-making and repair strategies. This discussion presents specific challenges that must be addressed to realistically improve the treatment of nerve injuries and promote widespread recovery. In particular, nerve defects a few centimeters in length use a sensory nerve autograft as the standard technique; however, this approach is limited by the availability of donor nerve and comorbidity associated with additional surgery. Moreover, we currently have an inadequate ability to noninvasively assess the degree of nerve injury and to track axonal regeneration. As a result, wait-and-see surgical decisions can lead to undesirable and less successful \"delayed\" repair procedures. In this fight for time, degeneration of the distal nerve support structure and target progresses, ultimately blunting complete functional recovery. Thus, the most pressing challenges in peripheral nerve repair include the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts that match or exceed the performance of autografts, the ability to noninvasively assess nerve damage and track axonal regeneration, and approaches to maintain the efficacy of the distal pathway and targets during the regenerative process.

The second is the fundamental unsolved problem of relating the parameters of the components and the environment to the phenotype of the global system. For example, knowing the parameters does not tell one how many qualitatively distinct phenotypes are in the organism's repertoire or the relative fitness of the phenotypes in different environments.

The paper specifically addresses the biomechanical factors for enhancement of the patency of coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs). Stenosis of distal anastomosis, caused by thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia (IH), is the major cause of failure of CABGs. Strong correlations have been established between the hemodynamics and vessel wall biomechanical factors and the initiation and development of IH and thrombus formation. Accordingly, several investigations have been conducted and numerous anastomotic geometries and devices have been designed to better regulate the blood flow fields and distribution of hemodynamic parameters and biomechanical factors at the distal anastomosis, in order to enhance the patency of CABGs. Enhancement of longevity and patency rate of CABGs can eliminate the need for re-operation and can significantly lower morbidity, and thereby reduces medical costs for patients suffering from coronary stenosis. This invited review focuses on various endeavors made thus far to design a patency-enhancing optimized anastomotic configuration for the distal junction of CABGs."]}, "paper_name": "Coronary artery bypass grafting hemodynamics and anastomosis design: a biomedical engineering review.", "paper_day": "NA", "paper_month": "NA", "paper_year": "NA"}, {"paper_id": "22065388", "paper_authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Dubini Gabriele"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Ambrosi Davide"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Bagnoli Paola"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Boschetti Federica"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Caiani Enrico G"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Chiastra Claudio"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Conti Carlo A"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Corsini Chiara"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Costantino Maria Laura"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "D'Angelo Carlo"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Formaggia Luca"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Fumero Roberto"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Gastaldi Dario"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Migliavacca Francesco"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Morlacchi Stefano"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Nobile Fabio"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Pennati Giancarlo"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Petrini Lorenza"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Quarteroni Alfio"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Redaelli Alberto"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Stevanella Marco"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Veneziani Alessandro"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Vergara Christian"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Votta Emiliano"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Wu Wei"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Zunino Paolo"}], "paper_abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Over the last twenty years major advancements have taken place in the design of medical devices and personalized therapies.

There seems to be an increasing trend of multiple author articles published across most journals. As the field of biomedical engineering also encompasses multidisciplinary-based knowledge, it is interesting to understand the authorship trend over time. In this study, six journals were carefully chosen from the Journal Citation Report of the Thomson Scientific based on predefined criteria (year 1999 to 2008). The data pertaining to authorships for the articles published in these journals were then acquired from the PubMed database. The results show that there is a general upward trend for the number of author per article, but it is not significant (p > .01) despite a 64.5% increase in the total number of article published in the six chosen journals. Thus, the expected increase is not observed in this field, and it may be due to the stringent guidelines by journals in defining the contributions of an author.

For gene delivery, non-viral polycationic-branched polyethylenimine (b-PEI) polyplexes are coated with pectin, an anionic polysaccharide, to enhance the polyplex stability and decrease b-PEI cytotoxicity. Perfluorinated materials, specifically perfluoroether, and perfluoro-polyether fluids are proposed as ultrasound contrast agents and smart agents for drug delivery. Non-fouling, self-assembled PEG-based monolayers are developed on titanium surfaces with the aim of drastically reducing cariogenic bacteria adhesion on dental implants. Femtosecond laser microfabrication is used for selectively and spatially tuning the wettability of polymeric biomaterials and the effects of femtosecond laser ablation on the surface properties of polymethylmethacrylate are studied. Innovative functionally graded Alumina-Ti coatings for wear resistant articulating surfaces are deposited with PLD and characterized by means of a combined experimental and computational approach. Protein adsorption on biomaterials surfaces with an unlike wettability and surface-modification induced by pre-adsorbed proteins are studied by atomistic computer simulations. A study was performed on the fabrication of porous Shape Memory Polymeric structures and on the assessment of their potential application in minimally invasive surgical procedures.
