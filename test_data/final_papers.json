[{"title": "Does the radiologic technologist or the fluoroscopy time affect treatment success with shockwave lithotripsy?", "abstract": " The minimally invasive nature and effectiveness of shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) has made it one of the primary treatment modalities for urinary tract calculi. Several factors determining the success of SWL treatment have been studied, including stone factors (ie, location, size, and composition) and patient factors (ie, patient habitus and skin-to-stone distance). Our objective was to determine if either the assisting radiologic technologist or the amount of fluoroscopy time used has an impact on SWL success.\n We compared the outcome of 536 SWL treatments across three radiologic technologists. We also evaluated the average amount of fluoroscopy time used in treatment success vs failures in this same cohort. The outcomes measured were stone-free and successful fragmentation rate at 2 weeks and 3 months. Successful fragmentation was defined as being either stone free, having residual sand, or with an asymptomatic fragment \u2264 4 mm on radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.\n The patients treated by the three different radiologic technologists were comparable with respect to body mass index, stone side and location, presence of ureteral stent, and mean stone area (mm(2)). The stone-free and successful fragmentation rates at 2 weeks and 3 months between the three radiologic technologists were not significantly different. When examining fluoroscopy time, we found a significantly greater mean fluoroscopy time was used in treatments with successful fragmentation at 2 weeks (3.16 min vs 2.72 min, P=0.0001) and 3 months (3.12 min vs 2.75 min, P=0.0015) compared with treatment failures.\n The radiologic technologist did not have a significant impact on SWL treatment outcome at 2 weeks and 3 months. Successful SWL fragmentation at 2 weeks and 3 months, however, was associated with a greater amount of fluoroscopy time, suggesting that using fluoroscopy to ensure accurate targeting during SWL is important for successful fragmentation.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013679"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.utoronto.ca"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Division of Urology, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. michael.ordon@utoronto.ca", "name": "Ordon Michael"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Urology, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. michael.ordon@utoronto.ca", "name": "Ghiculete Daniela"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Urology, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. michael.ordon@utoronto.ca", "name": "Pace Kenneth T"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Urology, St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. michael.ordon@utoronto.ca", "name": "Honey R John D'A"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22316287"}, {"title": "The impact of workplace factors on evidence-based speech-language pathology practice for children with autism spectrum disorders.", "abstract": " Although researchers have examined barriers to implementing evidence-based practice (EBP) at the level of the individual, little is known about the effects workplaces have on speech-language pathologists' implementation of EBP. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of workplace factors on the use of EBP amongst speech-language pathologists who work with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This study sought to (a) explore views about EBP amongst speech-language pathologists who work with children with ASD, (b) identify workplace factors which, in the participants' opinions, acted as barriers or enablers to their provision of evidence-based speech-language pathology services, and (c) examine whether or not speech-language pathologists' responses to workplace factors differed based on the type of workplace or their years of experience. A total of 105 speech-language pathologists from across Australia completed an anonymous online questionnaire. The results indicate that, although the majority of speech-language pathologists agreed that EBP is necessary, they experienced barriers to their implementation of EBP including workplace culture and support, lack of time, cost of EBP, and the availability and accessibility of EBP resources. The barriers reported by speech-language pathologists were similar, regardless of their workplace (private practice vs organization) and years of experience.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.usyd.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.", "name": "Cheung Gladys"}, {"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.", "name": "Trembath David"}, {"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.", "name": "Arciuli Joanne"}, {"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.", "name": "Togher Leanne"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22967045"}, {"title": "The role of biomedical engineering in disaster management in resource-limited settings.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001698"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.bu.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA.", "name": "Fernandes Andrea"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA 02215, USA.", "name": "Zaman Muhammad H"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22893748"}, {"title": "[Comparison of biomedical engineering education between Southeast University (China) and American universities].", "abstract": " Taking Duke University as an example, this article makes a comparison between the major of biomedical engineering in the Southeast University and that in American universities in term of subject direction, faculty, teaching principle and status of publishing academic papers.

This paper outlines the development and implementation of four integrated laboratory classes (ILCs) at King Saud University College of Medicine. It also examines whether core concepts addressed in these classes were learned and retained and how the students perceived the ILCs.\n ILCs are based on enhancing enquiry-based learning, and encouraging students to work on tasks in small groups (apply and integrate knowledge from biochemistry, pathology and microbiology) and conduct a laboratory procedure (practical part). In two of these ILCs, a pretest comprising 15 multiple-choice questions were administrated at the start of the class and an identical posttest was administrated at the end of these classes. Performance of the students in the Objective Structured Practical Examination (OSPE) at the end of the blocks was also evaluated. Students' perceptions were evaluated using a questionnaire completed at the end of each class.\n A total of 247, 252, 238, and 244 students participated in practical classes covering cerebrospinal fluid infection, small intestine, liver function tests and adrenal gland function, respectively. Students got higher scores in posttests compared to pre-test scores in two classes (12.68\u2009\u00b1\u20092.03 vs 6.58\u2009\u00b1\u20093.39 and 13.02\u2009\u00b1\u20092.03 vs 7.43\u2009\u00b1\u20092.68, respectively).

The mean scores of students in stations dealing with ILCs at the end of the block examinations were not significantly different from the mean scores for other stations not related to ILCs. The questionnaire indicated that most students expressed positive attitude towards working on tasks and applying knowledge learnt. Students also felt that conducting laboratory procedures and interpreting laboratory findings were valuable to their learning.\n Given the increase in the posttest scores (short-term retention) and the satisfactory performance of students at the end of block examinations (long-term retention) together with the students' satisfaction, the study suggests that the core concepts addressed in these classes were learned and retained.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013677"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.ksu.edu.sa", "http://www.ksu.edu.sa"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Medical Education and Curriculum Development & Research Unit, College of Medicine, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia. azer2000@optusnet.com.au", "name": "Azer Samy A"}, {"affiliation": "Medical Education and Curriculum Development & Research Unit, College of Medicine, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia. azer2000@optusnet.com.au", "name": "Hasanato Rana"}, {"affiliation": "Medical Education and Curriculum Development & Research Unit, College of Medicine, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia. azer2000@optusnet.com.au", "name": "Al-Nassar Sami"}, {"affiliation": "Medical Education and Curriculum Development & Research Unit, College of Medicine, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia. azer2000@optusnet.com.au", "name": "Somily Ali"}, {"affiliation": "Medical Education and Curriculum Development & Research Unit, College of Medicine, King Saud University, PO Box 2925, Riyadh 11461, Saudi Arabia. azer2000@optusnet.com.au", "name": "AlSaadi Muslim M"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23706014"}, {"title": "Working with transgender clients: learning from physicians and nurses to improve occupational therapy practice.", "abstract": " Gender identity disorder and the process of transitioning involve both mental and physical health, yet there is virtually no discussion of transgender health care in occupational therapy.\n This study draws on interviews with primary-care nurses and physicians about their experience with transgender health care, extending the insights gleaned there to make suggestions for occupational therapy practice with this population.\n Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 primary care nurses and 9 physicians who had clinical experience with lesbian, gay, and bisexual patients.\n Participants felt uncertain about transgender care, wanting more specialized knowledge.

Although more intense intervention can lead to better outcomes, the relationship between intensity and outcome is not always linear. More is not always better. Non-intense and intense schedules can yield similar outcomes. Intensity can also reach a point of diminishing return. The insights offered by the authors illustrate the challenges involved in studying this complex issue. To establish the optimal intensity of interventions in speech-language pathology our field needs to: identify active ingredients of interventions; better understand how principles of motor learning and neural plasticity facilitate learning; appreciate the contribution of individuals characteristics, values, and preferences; discover the effect of specific combinations of intensity (including dose, dose form, dose frequency, session duration, and total intervention duration) on treatment outcomes, and find practical solutions when disparities exist between research recommendations and workplace limitations.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.usyd.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Australia. elise.baker@sydney.edu.au", "name": "Baker Elise"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22974107"}, {"title": "The pipeline still leaks and more than you think: a status report on gender diversity in biomedical engineering.", "abstract": " While the percentage of women in biomedical engineering is higher than in many other technical fields, it is far from being in proportion to the US population.

Strong correlations have been established between the hemodynamics and vessel wall biomechanical factors and the initiation and development of IH and thrombus formation. Accordingly, several investigations have been conducted and numerous anastomotic geometries and devices have been designed to better regulate the blood flow fields and distribution of hemodynamic parameters and biomechanical factors at the distal anastomosis, in order to enhance the patency of CABGs. Enhancement of longevity and patency rate of CABGs can eliminate the need for re-operation and can significantly lower morbidity, and thereby reduces medical costs for patients suffering from coronary stenosis.

Dominant social assumptions about the value of walking are shown to shape individual choices and contribute to parental feelings of angst and doubt, and negative self-identities for children. The example reveals how critical approaches to research can be used to reveal the socio-political dimension of rehabilitation practice and address important research questions that have been largely neglected.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68026761"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.utoronto.ca"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. barbara.gibson@utoronto.ca", "name": "Gibson Barbara E"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Physical Therapy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. barbara.gibson@utoronto.ca", "name": "Teachman Gail"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22507195"}, {"title": "The Annals of Biomedical Engineering: inception to signature journal.", "abstract": " The Annals of Biomedical Engineering, the flagship journal of the Biomedical Engineering Society, developed through four distinct stages.

The first is the fundamental unsolved problem of relating the digital representation of the genotype to the analog representation of the parameters for the molecular components. For example, knowing the DNA sequence does not allow one to determine the kinetic parameters of an enzyme. The second is the fundamental unsolved problem of relating the parameters of the components and the environment to the phenotype of the global system. For example, knowing the parameters does not tell one how many qualitatively distinct phenotypes are in the organism's repertoire or the relative fitness of the phenotypes in different environments. These also are challenges for biomedical engineers as they attempt to develop therapeutic strategies to treat pathology or to redirect normal cellular functions for biotechnological purposes. In this article, the second of these fundamental challenges will be addressed, and the notion of a \"system design space\" for relating the parameter space of components to the phenotype space of bioengineering systems will be focused upon. First, the concept of a system design space will be motivated by introducing one of its key components from an intuitive perspective. Second, a simple linear example will be used to illustrate a generic method for constructing the design space in which qualitatively distinct phenotypes can be identified and counted, their fitness analyzed and compared, and their tolerance to change measured. Third, two examples of nonlinear systems from different areas of biomedical engineering will be presented. Finally, after giving reference to a few other applications that have made use of the system design space approach to reveal important design principles, some concluding remarks concerning challenges and opportunities for further development will be made.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001698"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.ucdavis.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California-Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616-5294, USA. masavageau@ucdavis.edu", "name": "Savageau Michael A"}], "month": "NA", "id": "21203848"}, {"title": "Occupational therapy for care home residents with stroke.", "abstract": " Stroke is a worldwide problem and is a leading cause of adult disability, resulting in dependency in activities of daily living (ADL) for around half of stroke survivors. It is estimated that up to 25% of all care home residents in the USA and in the UK have had a stroke.\u00a0Stroke survivors who reside in care homes are likely to be more physically and cognitively impaired and therefore more dependent than those able to remain in their own home. Overall, 75% of care home residents are classified as severely disabled, and those with stroke are likely to have high levels of immobility, incontinence and confusion, as well as additional co-morbidities. It is not known whether this clinically complex population could benefit from occupational therapy in the same way as community-dwelling stroke survivors. The care home population with stroke differs from the general stroke population living at home, and a review was needed to examine the benefits of occupational therapy provided to this specific group. This review therefore focused on occupational therapy interventions for ADL for stroke survivors residing in care homes.\n To measure the effects of occupational therapy interventions (provided directly by an occupational therapist or under the supervision of an occupational therapist) targeted at improving, restoring and maintaining independence in ADL among stroke survivors residing in long-term institutional care, termed collectively as 'care homes'. As a secondary objective, we aimed to evaluate occupational therapy interventions for reducing complications such as depression and low mood.\n We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, September 2012), MEDLINE (1948 to September 2012), EMBASE (1980 to September 2012), CINAHL (1982 to September 2012) and 10 additional bibliographic databases and six trials registers. We also handsearched seven journals, checked reference lists and obtained further information from individual trialists.\n Randomised controlled trials investigating the impact of an occupational therapy intervention for care home residents with stroke versus standard care.\n The lead review author performed all searches. Two review authors then independently assessed all titles and abstracts of studies and selected trials for inclusion, with a third review author resolving any discrepancies. The same two review authors independently extracted data from all included published sources to ensure reliability. Primary outcomes were performance in ADL at the end of scheduled follow-up and death or a poor outcome. Secondary outcomes aimed to reflect the domains targeted by an occupational therapy intervention.\n We included in the review one study involving 118 participants. We found one ongoing study that also met the inclusion criteria for the review, but the data were not yet available.\n We found insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of occupational therapy interventions for improving, restoring or maintaining independence in ADL for stroke survivors residing in care homes. The effectiveness of occupational therapy for the population of stroke survivors residing in care homes remains unclear, and further research in this area is warranted.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.nottingham.ac.uk"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing,University ofNottingham,Nottingham,UK. joanna.fletcher-smith@nottingham.ac.uk.", "name": "Fletcher-Smith Joanna C"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing,University ofNottingham,Nottingham,UK. joanna.fletcher-smith@nottingham.ac.uk.", "name": "Walker Marion F"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing,University ofNottingham,Nottingham,UK. joanna.fletcher-smith@nottingham.ac.uk.", "name": "Cobley Christine S"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing,University ofNottingham,Nottingham,UK. joanna.fletcher-smith@nottingham.ac.uk.", "name": "Steultjens Esther M J"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing,University ofNottingham,Nottingham,UK. joanna.fletcher-smith@nottingham.ac.uk.", "name": "Sackley Catherine M"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23740541"}, {"title": "Student diversity and implications for clinical competency development amongst domestic and international speech-language pathology students.", "abstract": " International students graduating from speech-language pathology university courses must achieve the same minimum competency standards as domestic students.

Simultaneously, caseloads have become more challenging and contexts more complex, which may be overwhelming to new graduates. The South African context offers a particularly interesting example of these challenges. Educators need to use innovative ways to ensure that curricula adequately prepare students for rural community work, while developing a sense of leadership that links clinical practice to theory, policy, ethics and social responsibility. Rural practica offer opportunities for sensitizing and equipping students for working in underserviced communities and a number of international studies have documented their potential usefulness. There is limited research, however, that examines how exposure to rural community work may shape students' responses to the realities of working in such contexts. This study aimed to explore the processes underlying a group of South African speech-language therapy and audiology students' appreciation and understanding of the realities of work in a rural community after a rural practicum.\n A four-day practicum took place in a rural community in South Africa. The practicum incorporated basic audiological tasks and structured observations. Twenty-five third-year students completed anonymous pre- and post-practicum open-ended questionnaires. The questionnaires explored their expectations and perceptions of the practicum, perceived challenges and benefits of working in rural community areas, and considerations that might need to be taken into account. The questionnaires were analysed and compared using thematic analysis principles.\n Results revealed a distinction between students' emotional and personal expectations of, and responses to, the practicum compared to their clinical expectations and responses. Before the practicum, students indicated a number of anxieties such as not feeling emotionally prepared or feeling anxious about infection control. The rural practicum appeared to provide a powerful teaching tool that led to growth in students' empathy and awareness of community needs and contextual issues through a shift from an intrapersonal to an interpersonal focus in their responses. A lack of growth was noted in some areas after the practicum, however, such as students' ideas about implementing appropriate therapy and making modifications to materials.\n This study holds significant implications for preparing students to work in challenging contexts and rural communities both in South Africa and abroad. The results suggest that a one-off practicum is not sufficient to sensitize students to the challenges of rural work and enable them to overcome anxieties. Rather, a sustained commitment to rural community work should be introduced early on in the curriculum and educators should be encouraged to reflect on their own attitudes, experiences, biases and anxieties towards community work.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001298"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.wits.ac.za"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology, School of Human and Community Development, University of the Witwatersrand, WITS, South Africa. jennifer.watermeyer@wits.ac.za", "name": "Watermeyer J"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology, School of Human and Community Development, University of the Witwatersrand, WITS, South Africa. jennifer.watermeyer@wits.ac.za", "name": "Barratt J"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23317350"}, {"title": "Current occupational therapy publications in home health: a scoping review.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.uic.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Doctor of Occupational Therapy Program, University of Illinois at Chicago, 6033 North Sheridan Road, 22E, Chicago, IL 60660, USA.

While there is a clear fit between occupational therapy and primary care, there have been few practice examples, despite a growing body of evidence to support the role. In 2010, the province of Ontario, Canada provided funding to include occupational therapists as members of Family Health Teams, an interprofessional model of primary care. The integration of occupational therapists into this model of primary care is one of the first large scale initiatives of its kind in North America. The objective of the study was to examine how occupational therapy services are being integrated into primary care teams and understand the structures supporting the integration.\n A multiple case study design was used to provide an in-depth description of the integration of occupational therapy. Four Family Health Teams with occupational therapists as part of the team were identified. Data collection included in-depth interviews, document analyses, and questionnaires.\n Each Family Health Team had a unique organizational structure that contributed to the integration of occupational therapy. Communication, trust and understanding of occupational therapy were key elements in the integration of occupational therapy into Family Health Teams, and were supported by a number of strategies including co-location, electronic medical records and team meetings. An understanding of occupational therapy was critical for integration into the team and physicians were less likely to understand the occupational therapy role than other health providers.\n With an increased emphasis on interprofessional primary care, new professions will be integrated into primary healthcare teams. The study found that explicit strategies and structures are required to facilitate the integration of a new professional group. An understanding of professional roles, trust and communication are foundations for interprofessional collaborative practice.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.queensu.ca"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, 31 George Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada. catherine.donnelly@queensu.ca", "name": "Donnelly Catherine"}, {"affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, 31 George Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada. catherine.donnelly@queensu.ca", "name": "Brenchley Christie"}, {"affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, 31 George Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada. catherine.donnelly@queensu.ca", "name": "Crawford Candace"}, {"affiliation": "School of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, 31 George Street, Kingston, ON, K7L 3N6, Canada. catherine.donnelly@queensu.ca", "name": "Letts Lori"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23679667"}, {"title": "Regulation of cell behavior and tissue patterning by bioelectrical signals: challenges and opportunities for biomedical engineering.", "abstract": " Achieving control over cell behavior and pattern formation requires molecular-level understanding of regulatory mechanisms.

Disparities between health services and challenges to achieving the equity objective have been documented both in Australia and around the world. However, little is known about the extent to which this objective has been met in the field of speech-language pathology in Australia. This study used structured interviews with 74 speech-language pathologists working in rural areas of New South Wales and Victoria. The data obtained were used to develop maps to describe the availability of paediatric speech-language pathology services through consideration of location and frequency. The findings show that 98.60% of localities are unserviced at the ideal frequency of weekly or more often. It is important to note that these percentages include all localities in the represented rural areas of New South Wales and Victoria, some of which are minimally populated. The maps also depict travel and distance as barriers to the accessibility of services and have been used to suggest a critical maximum distance for paediatric outpatient speech-language pathology services in rural New South Wales and Victoria. From the data collected, 50 kilometres was suggested as the critical maximum distance past which consumers become unable or unwilling to travel to access weekly rural speech-language pathology services in rural New South Wales and Victoria. Thus, people living in almost one third of rural localities in rural New South Wales and Victoria lie beyond what is considered by rural speech-language pathologists to be a reasonable travel distance to weekly speech-language pathology services. These results highlight barriers to the achievement of equitable services in rural areas. The results also provide an essential foundation to inform policy development and assist health service planning to meet the needs of rural consumers.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.csu.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Community Health, Charles Sturt University, Albury, Australia.", "name": "Verdon Sarah"}, {"affiliation": "School of Community Health, Charles Sturt University, Albury, Australia.", "name": "Wilson Linda"}, {"affiliation": "School of Community Health, Charles Sturt University, Albury, Australia.", "name": "Smith-Tamaray Michelle"}, {"affiliation": "School of Community Health, Charles Sturt University, Albury, Australia.", "name": "McAllister Lindy"}], "month": "NA", "id": "21563898"}, {"title": "Assessing asymmetry using reflection and rotoinversion in biomedical engineering applications.", "abstract": " Symmetry is a trait that has been extensively reviewed, especially clinically, as an indication of ideal geometry and health.

In this article, two methods, reflection and a process termed rotoinversion, a combination of reflection and rotation, are presented as potential methods to assess an object's deviation from symmetry. With reflection, the geometric models are reflected about a calculated best plane of symmetry. With rotoinversion, the models are reflected about an arbitrary plane and then rigidly translated and rotated to best align the translated and original models. The methods give the same results for bilaterally symmetric objects, but different results for bilaterally and rotationally symmetric objects. The two methods are applied to assess asymmetry in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis torso geometric models, producing similar results. There was an angle of 0.408\u00b0 between the normal to the plane of reflection from the reflection process and the normal from the rotoinversion process and average rotation of 0.067\u00b0 from rotoinversion.

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) are viewed as experts in the field of communication. However, many SLP students do not receive practical training in techniques to communicate with people with aphasia (PWA) until they encounter PWA during clinical education placements.\n This study investigated the confidence and knowledge of SLP students in communicating with PWA prior to clinical placements using a customised questionnaire. Confidence in communicating with people with aphasia was assessed using a 100-point visual analogue scale. Linear, and logistic, regressions were used to examine the association between confidence and age, as well as confidence and course type (graduate-entry masters or undergraduate), respectively. Knowledge of strategies to assist communication with PWA was examined by asking respondents to list specific strategies that could assist communication with PWA.\n SLP students were not confident with the prospect of communicating with PWA; reporting a median 29-points (inter-quartile range 17-47) on the visual analogue confidence scale. Only, four (8.2%) of respondents rated their confidence greater than 55 (out of 100). Regression analyses indicated no relationship existed between confidence and students' age (p = 0.31, r-squared = 0.02), or confidence and course type (p = 0.22, pseudo r-squared = 0.03). Students displayed limited knowledge about communication strategies. Thematic analysis of strategies revealed four overarching themes; Physical, Verbal Communication, Visual Information and Environmental Changes. While most students identified potential use of resources (such as images and written information), fewer students identified strategies to alter their verbal communication (such as reduced speech rate).\n SLP students who had received aphasia related theoretical coursework, but not commenced clinical placements with PWA, were not confident in their ability to communicate with PWA. Students may benefit from an educational intervention or curriculum modification to incorporate practical training in effective strategies to communicate with PWA, before they encounter PWA in clinical settings. Ensuring students have confidence and knowledge of potential communication strategies to assist communication with PWA may allow them to focus their learning experiences in more specific clinical domains, such as clinical reasoning, rather than building foundation interpersonal communication skills.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.uq.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.", "name": "Finch Emma"}, {"affiliation": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.", "name": "Fleming Jennifer"}, {"affiliation": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.", "name": "Brown Kyla"}, {"affiliation": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.", "name": "Lethlean Jennifer"}, {"affiliation": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.", "name": "Cameron Ashley"}, {"affiliation": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.", "name": "McPhail Steven M"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23806028"}, {"title": "Investigating the experiences in a school-based occupational therapy program to inform community-based paediatric occupational therapy practice.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.curtin.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Occupational Therapy and Social Work, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.", "name": "Rens Lezahn"}, {"affiliation": "School of Occupational Therapy and Social Work, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.", "name": "Joosten Annette"}], "month": "NA", "id": "24325325"}, {"title": "A geographical analysis of speech-language pathology services to support multilingual children.", "abstract": " The speech-language pathology workforce strives to provide equitable, quality services to multilingual people.

This paper reviews selected approaches currently being investigated at Politecnico di Milano in the field of regenerative medicine. Specific tissue-oriented topics are divided in three sections according to each developmental stage: in vitro study, pre-clinical study, and clinical application. In vitro studies investigate the basic phenomena related to gene delivery, stem cell behavior, tissue regeneration, and to explore dynamic culture potentiality in different applications: cardiac and skeletal muscle, cartilage, hematopoietic system, peripheral nerve, and gene delivery. Specific fields of regenerative medicine, i.e., bone, blood vessels, and ligaments engineering have already reached the preclinical stage providing promising insights for further research towards clinical applications. The translation of the results obtained during in vitro and preclinical steps into clinical organ replacement is a very challenging issue, which can offer a valid alternative to fight morbidity, organ shortage, and ethical-social problems associated with allotransplantation as shown in the clinical case reported in this review.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001698"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.polimi.it"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Asnaghi M Adelaide"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Candiani Gabriele"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Far\u00e8 Silvia"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Fiore Gianfranco B"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Petrini Paola"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Raimondi Manuela T"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Soncini Monica"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy.", "name": "Mantero Sara"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22065385"}, {"title": "Systematic reviews informing occupational therapy.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.uq.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Division of Occupational Therapy, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072 Australia. sally.bennett@uq.edu.au", "name": "Bennett Sally"}, {"affiliation": "University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Division of Occupational Therapy, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072 Australia. sally.bennett@uq.edu.au", "name": "Hoffmann Tammy"}, {"affiliation": "University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Division of Occupational Therapy, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072 Australia. sally.bennett@uq.edu.au", "name": "McCluskey Annie"}, {"affiliation": "University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Division of Occupational Therapy, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072 Australia. sally.bennett@uq.edu.au", "name": "Coghlan Nicole"}, {"affiliation": "University of Queensland, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, Division of Occupational Therapy, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072 Australia. sally.bennett@uq.edu.au", "name": "Tooth Leigh"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23597693"}, {"title": "A 2012 survey of the Australasian clinical medical physics and biomedical engineering workforce.", "abstract": " A survey of the medical physics and biomedical engineering workforce in Australia and New Zealand was carried out in 2012 following on from similar surveys in 2009 and 2006. 761 positions (equivalent to 736 equivalent full time (EFT) positions) were captured by the survey.

A British Society of Audiology Cognition in Hearing Special Interest Group 'white paper'", "abstract": " Objective: There is growing interest in the concepts of listening effort and fatigue associated with hearing loss. However, the theoretical underpinnings and clinical meaning of these concepts are unclear. This lack of clarity reflects both the relative immaturity of the field and the fact that research studies investigating listening effort and fatigue have used a variety of methodologies including self-report, behavioural, and physiological measures. Design: This discussion paper provides working definitions for listening effort and listening-related fatigue. Using these definitions as a framework, methodologies to assess these constructs are reviewed. Results: Although each technique attempts to characterize the same construct (i.e. the clinical presentation of listening effort and fatigue), different assumptions are often made about the nature of these phenomena and their behavioural and physiological manifestations. Conclusion: We suggest that researchers consider these assumptions when interpreting their data and, where possible, make predictions based on current theoretical knowledge to add to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of listening effort and listening-related fatigue. Foreword Following recent interest in the cognitive involvement in hearing, the British Society of Audiology (BSA) established a Special Interest Group on Cognition in Hearing in May 2013. In an exploratory group meeting, the ambiguity surrounding listening effort and fatigue was discussed. To address this problem, the group decided to develop a 'white paper' on listening effort and fatigue. This is a discussion document followed by an international set of commentaries from leading researchers in the field. An approach was made to the editor of the International Journal of Audiology who agreed to this suggestion. This paper, and the associated commentaries that follow, are the result.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001298"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.manchester.ac.uk"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "McGarrigle Ronan"}, {"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "Munro Kevin J"}, {"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "Dawes Piers"}, {"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "Stewart Andrew J"}, {"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "Moore David R"}, {"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "Barry Johanna G"}, {"affiliation": "* School of Psychological Sciences, the University of Manchester , UK.", "name": "Amitay Sygal"}], "month": "NA", "id": "24673660"}, {"title": "Occupational therapy for patients with acute lung injury: factors associated with time to first intervention in the intensive care unit.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.jhu.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Outcomes after Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.", "name": "Dinglas Victor D"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Outcomes after Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.", "name": "Colantuoni Elizabeth"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Outcomes after Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.", "name": "Ciesla Nancy"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Outcomes after Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.", "name": "Mendez-Tellez Pedro A"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Outcomes after Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.", "name": "Shanholtz Carl"}, {"affiliation": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Outcomes after Critical Illness and Surgery (OACIS) Group, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.", "name": "Needham Dale M"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23597694"}, {"title": "Application of the Human Activity Assistive Technology model for occupational therapy research.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.umanitoba.ca"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Occupational Therapy, School of Medical Rehabilitation, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Fifty undergraduate students and 13 recent graduates completed a questionnaire that tapped three main areas, level of student debt, intentions to emigrate, and career intentions. Ninety-seven per cent of respondents were female, with a median age of 25 years. Most SLP students and graduates had high levels of debt on graduation. Debt contributed to levels of worry and the ability to participate in education. However, debt alone did not influence career choice or long-term career planning. Over half of the respondents intended to leave New Zealand within 2 years of graduation, citing salary, travel, and training opportunities as factors. Incentives to remain in the profession included increased salary, more training opportunities, and student debt repayment. SLP students' career decisions were mainly influenced by interest in the profession. The conclusion was that three main factors need to be explored in an effort to increase the likelihood that SLPs remain in New Zealand: salary levels, increased training opportunities, and contributions to reduce student debt.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.canterbury.ac.nz"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "University of Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand. gina.tillard@canterbury.ac.nz", "name": "Tillard Gina D A"}], "month": "NA", "id": "21793778"}, {"title": "Mining and analysis of audiology data to find significant factors associated with tinnitus masker.", "abstract": " The objective of this research is to find the factors associated with tinnitus masker from the literature, and by using the large amount of audiology data available from a large NHS (National Health Services, UK) hearing aid clinic.

Although recovery of nerve function occurs in many mild injuries, outcomes are often unsatisfactory following severe trauma. Nerve repair and regeneration presents unique clinical challenges and opportunities, and substantial contributions can be made through the informed application of biomedical engineering strategies. This article reviews the clinical presentations and classification of nerve injuries, in addition to the state of the art for surgical decision-making and repair strategies. This discussion presents specific challenges that must be addressed to realistically improve the treatment of nerve injuries and promote widespread recovery. In particular, nerve defects a few centimeters in length use a sensory nerve autograft as the standard technique; however, this approach is limited by the availability of donor nerve and comorbidity associated with additional surgery. Moreover, we currently have an inadequate ability to noninvasively assess the degree of nerve injury and to track axonal regeneration. As a result, wait-and-see surgical decisions can lead to undesirable and less successful \"delayed\" repair procedures. In this fight for time, degeneration of the distal nerve support structure and target progresses, ultimately blunting complete functional recovery. Thus, the most pressing challenges in peripheral nerve repair include the development of tissue-engineered nerve grafts that match or exceed the performance of autografts, the ability to noninvasively assess nerve damage and track axonal regeneration, and approaches to maintain the efficacy of the distal pathway and targets during the regenerative process. Biomedical engineering strategies can address these issues to substantially contribute at both the basic and applied levels, improving surgical management and functional recovery following severe peripheral nerve injury.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001698"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.njit.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.", "name": "Pfister Bryan J"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.", "name": "Gordon Tessa"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.", "name": "Loverde Joseph R"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.", "name": "Kochar Arshneel S"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.", "name": "Mackinnon Susan E"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA.", "name": "Cullen D Kacy"}], "month": "NA", "id": "21488817"}, {"title": "Sixty-five years of Physical Therapy: bibliometric analysis of research publications from 1945 through 2010.", "abstract": " The generation of research can be likened to the production of consumer goods, with a producer (the study authors and funders), a product (the study and publications arising from it), and consumers (those who read and cite the published study).\n The aim of this study was to use bibliometric indexes to track changes in the producers, products, and consumers of the journal Physical Therapy from 1945 through 2010.\n An analysis of published manuscripts (excluding letters, editorials, corrections, commentaries, and book reviews) in Physical Therapy was performed using a reliable bibliometric audit tool.

Although many questions related to aspects such as quality control, licensure, jurisdictional responsibility, certification and reimbursement still need to be addressed; no alternative strategy can currently offer the same potential reach for impacting the global burden of hearing loss in the near and foreseeable future.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001298"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.up.ac.za"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Swanepoel De Wet"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Clark Jackie L"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Koekemoer Dirk"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Hall James W"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Krumm Mark"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Ferrari Deborah V"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "McPherson Bradley"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Olusanya Bolajoko O"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Mars Maurice"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Russo I\u00eada"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Communication Pathology, University of Pretoria, South Africa. dewet.swanepoel@up.ac.za", "name": "Barajas Jose J"}], "month": "NA", "id": "20151929"}, {"title": "Reasons identified for seeking the American Physical Therapy Association-Credentialed Clinical Instructor Program (CCIP) in Florida.", "abstract": " The American Physical Therapy Association's (APTA) Strategic Plan strives to increase the number of APTA credentialed clinical instructors.

APTA CCIP credentialed trainers (n=5) developed a survey and pilot tested for face and content validity. The instrument included demographics, forced choice and open-ended questions. The pre/post survey was administered to 301 participants of 21 Florida APTA CCIP courses with 5 trainers from 2009-2011. Quantitative survey data were collated, tabulated, and summarized comparing pre/post data. Narrative data was analyzed for codes and themes, synthesized, re-contextualized and triangulated by trainers then cross-compared with APTA CCIP objectives and trainer expertise. The qualitative insights were presented with resulting primary themes and subthemes.\n Results informed the study purposes with a clear determination of the reasons participants attend the APTA CCIP, the pre-course goals and post learning outcomes. Participants overwhelmingly recommend the APTA CCIP and most receive support from employers with geographic course location being a prime reason for course selection. Precourse learning goals included 5 over-arching themes, with few sub-themes; while post learning outcomes generated 12 specific themes with numerous subthemes.\n APTA CCIP-credentialed clinical instructors are achieving numerous learning outcomes immediately applicable for clinical education.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68026761"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.usf.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of South Florida, Morsani College of Medicine, 12901 Bruce B.

However, client-centred practice has been subjected to little critical reflection within the occupational therapy profession. The aim of this paper is to foster critical reflection concerning the authenticity and veracity of the profession's commitment to client-centred practices.\n Client-centred practice is defined without evident reference to clients' perspectives. Few occupational therapy researchers have sought clients' perceptions of the client-centred nature of their occupational therapy services. Occupational therapy research is neither consistently undertaken in a collaborative manner, nor are the profession's theories developed through explicit reference to a diversity of clients' perspectives. Professional practices and service evaluations do not consistently seek clients' viewpoints. Client-centred rhetoric is politically expedient and may be a professionalizing strategy employed to increase status and entrench power.\n Although exemplary client-centred occupational therapy practices exist, evidence suggests that the profession does not adhere consistently to its espoused client-centred principle in all its practices. The client-centred practice of occupational therapy should be subjected to assiduous critical reflection.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.ubc.ca"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. ik.hammell@sasktel.net", "name": "Hammell Karen R Whalley"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23256524"}, {"title": "Use of information and communication technology among dental students and registrars at the faculty of dental sciences, University of Lagos.", "abstract": " The aim of this study was to investigate the use of information technology amongst dental students, dental nursing students and resident doctors in training at the faculty of dental Surgery University of Lagos.

Clinical trials with outcomes of mortality, length of hospital and ICU stay, physical function and quality of life, muscle strength, and ventilator-free days were included.\n Two reviewers abstracted data and assessed quality independently. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. From 3,126 screened abstracts, 10 randomized controlled trials and five reviews were found. The mean Physiotherapy Evidence Database score was 5.4. Overall there was a significant positive effect favoring physical therapy for the critically ill to improve the quality of life (g = 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.08, 0.71), physical function (g = 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.13, 0.78), peripheral muscle strength (g = 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.02, 0.52), and respiratory muscle strength (g = 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.12, 0.89). Length of hospital (g = -0.34, 95% confidence interval -0.53, -0.15) and ICU stay (g = -0.34, 95% confidence interval -0.51, -0.18) significantly decreased and ventilator-free days increased (g = 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.16, 0.59) following physical therapy in the ICU. There was no effect on mortality.\n Physical therapy in the ICU appears to confer significant benefit in improving quality of life, physical function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, increasing ventilator-free days, and decreasing hospital and ICU stay. However, further controlled trials of better quality and larger sample sizes are required to verify the strength of these tentative associations.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68026761"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.uq.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Burns, Trauma and Critical Care Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. g.kayambu@uq.edu.au", "name": "Kayambu Geetha"}, {"affiliation": "Burns, Trauma and Critical Care Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. g.kayambu@uq.edu.au", "name": "Boots Robert"}, {"affiliation": "Burns, Trauma and Critical Care Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. g.kayambu@uq.edu.au", "name": "Paratz Jennifer"}], "month": "NA", "id": "23528802"}, {"title": "A systematic program of research regarding the assessment of speech-language pathology competencies.", "abstract": " This paper explores the nature and development of competence in speech-language pathology and is informed by the development and validation of a competency-based assessment tool to assess Australian speech-language pathology students' professional performance in the workplace (COMPASS).

Findings relevant to understanding the nature and development of speech-language pathology competency are described. The domains of competence considered important for practice were found to extend beyond specific processes of professional practice to include generic competencies of reasoning, communication, lifelong learning, and professionalism. The achievement of competency was identified as developmental, and clinical educators were found to validly and reliably identify seven levels of competency development. Competency may transfer across the scope of practice, and marginal students' performances were characterized by a high degree of variability. These findings are discussed in relation to the profession's understanding of competency and speech-language pathology education, professional development, and further research.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.usyd.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. sue.mcallister@flinders.edu.au", "name": "McAllister Sue"}, {"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. sue.mcallister@flinders.edu.au", "name": "Lincoln Michelle"}, {"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. sue.mcallister@flinders.edu.au", "name": "Ferguson Alison"}, {"affiliation": "The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. sue.mcallister@flinders.edu.au", "name": "McAllister Lindy"}], "month": "NA", "id": "21846166"}, {"title": "Design of occupational therapy on-road test routes and related validity issues.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68009788"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.latrobe.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Occupational Therapy, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. m.distefano@latrobe.edu.au", "name": "Di Stefano Marilyn"}, {"affiliation": "School of Occupational Therapy, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. m.distefano@latrobe.edu.au", "name": "Macdonald Wendy"}], "month": "NA", "id": "22272881"}, {"title": "Paediatric speech-language pathology service delivery: an exploratory survey of Australian parents.", "abstract": " Consideration of client values and preferences for service delivery is integral to engaging with the evidence-based practice triangle (E(3)BP), but as yet such preferences are under-researched.

This study compared and contrasted the perceptions of role, responsibilities, communication, and teamworking of dental technology students in a traditional curriculum with those in an interprofessional curriculum, both in Australia. A social demographic questionnaire and two standard self-report measures were used to collect data from each year group of the two programs. Thirty to thirty-two of the thirty-nine students enrolled in a traditional dental technology program and nineteen to twenty-two of twenty-five students enrolled in an interprofessional curriculum completed surveys. Statistical analysis of self-report measures identified a significant difference in professional identity, development of roles, and perception of enhanced opportunities for collaboration of dental technologists with the wider oral health professions in those undertaking the interprofessional curriculum. This study suggests that interprofessional learning can shift traditional attitudes and, potentially, improve opportunities for collaboration between dentists and dental technicians. It also supports the idea that adoption of an interprofessional curriculum can significantly enhance communication and teamwork skills essential for readiness in the workplace.\n", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013674"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.griffith.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, 4222, Queensland, Australia. j.evans@griffith.edu.au", "name": "Evans Jane L"}, {"affiliation": "School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, 4222, Queensland, Australia. j.evans@griffith.edu.au", "name": "Henderson Amanda"}, {"affiliation": "School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus, 4222, Queensland, Australia. j.evans@griffith.edu.au", "name": "Johnson Newell W"}], "month": "NA", "id": "24002862"}, {"title": "Impact of placement type on the development of clinical competency in speech-language pathology students.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68013066"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.usyd.edu.au"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Work Integrated Learning, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney, Lidcombe, NSW, Australia.", "name": "Sheepway Lyndal"}, {"affiliation": "Work Integrated Learning, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney, Lidcombe, NSW, Australia.", "name": "Lincoln Michelle"}, {"affiliation": "Work Integrated Learning, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney, Lidcombe, NSW, Australia.", "name": "McAllister Sue"}], "month": "NA", "id": "24182204"}, {"title": "Falls in the audiology clinic: a pilot study.", "abstract": "", "year": "NA", "meshterms": ["68001298"], "day": "NA", "affiliation": ["http://www.unl.edu"], "authors": [{"affiliation": "Department of Special Education and Communication Disorders, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE.", "name": "Criter Robin E"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Special Education and Communication Disorders, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE.", "name": "Honaker Julie A"}], "month": "NA", "id": "24384085"}, {"title": "Developing evidence-based physical therapy clinical practice guidelines.", "abstract": " Recommended strategies for developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are provided.\n The intent is that future CPGs developed with the support of the Section on Pediatrics of the American Physical Therapy Association would consistently follow similar developmental processes to yield consistent quality and presentation.
